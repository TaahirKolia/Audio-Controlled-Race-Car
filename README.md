# Audio-Controlled-Race-Car

This project involved designing and implementing a remote-controlled car which utilises an audio link between a controller and the car. The implemented solution utilises an app to emit tones at specific frequencies that are detected by a microphone on the car. These frequencies dictate the movement of the car as there are commands associated with. A second order bandpass filter is introduced to ensure that external noise is minimised and so that only tones associated with commands are processed. A Fast Fourier Transform is then performed on the filtered signal to extract the intended frequencies. The motors are controlled via a H-bridge motor driver. The final solution performed satisfactorily once tested as it was able to complete a lap around a racetrack without hinderance from the external noise present in the environment.
